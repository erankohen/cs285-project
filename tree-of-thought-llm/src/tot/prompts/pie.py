This code is slow because it is using a brute force approach to find the square root of the input number. It is looping through every possible number starting from 0 until n. Note that the sqare root will be smaller than n, so at least half of the numbers it is looping through are unnecessary. At most, you need to loop through the numbers up to the square root of n.

This code is slow because it is using a brute force approach to search for the target number in the list of numbers. It is looping through the list for every target number, which can take a long time if the list is very large. A more efficient approach would be to use a data structure such as a hash table, which can perform lookups in constant time.
